# Checkout-scripts

The codebase for our game [Checkout!](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2757500/Checkout/) available on Steam.

All the programming on this game was done by me, I upload the scripts mainly as a portfolio but feel free to grab a snippet of anything you find useful.

As in any project, some systems are a little more thought out and others are just cobbled together quickly to get the game out the door in a finite amount of time.
